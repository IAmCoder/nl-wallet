# EDI - NL Public Reference Wallet

Within the European Digital Identity program of the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations,
a team is working on a Dutch Public Reference Wallet: the NL Wallet. The program conducts its work
in an open and transparent way. This means that the products of the development team â€“ the app
designs and source code â€“ are viewable for everyone who wants to. Itâ€™s also possible to contribute
to the project. We offer three platforms for contributions: [Pleio](https://edi.pleio.nl) as a
central hub, [GitHub](https://github.com/MinBZK/nl-wallet-demo-app) for the source code
and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/dO5pKIIIyDgG0N2ZX4C2xd/2212_V1_Designs_NL-Voorbeeld-Wallet?node-id=1%3A3717&t=nwzAEOJZJEb0eC0o-1)
for screens/flows.

The development of a public and open source reference wallet is a dynamic process. What has been
released in the current version, may in a next version be developed further, be modified drastically
or even removed altogether.

We look forward to
your [feedback and great ideas](mailto:edi@minbzk.nl?subject=Contribution%20via%20GitHub).

### Managing expectations

Itâ€™s important to note that a demo app will always be developed ahead of an actually functioning
wallet. A clickable demo app contains little technical implementation under the hood. That makes it
fast and easy to explore, visualize and discuss different scenarios and possibilities. It also
provides a testbed for engineers to explore / experiment / try out certain technical aspects of a
wallet.

When you look at the screens
in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/dO5pKIIIyDgG0N2ZX4C2xd/2212_V1_Designs_NL-Voorbeeld-Wallet?node-id=1%3A3717&t=nwzAEOJZJEb0eC0o-1)
or in the demo app, they suggest a lot of functionality that seems to work, but which still requires
a lot of development to realize in practice.

Itâ€™s possible to use such a wallet in a lot of different situations, for example to share your
diplomaâ€™s when applying for a job, or to prove that youâ€™re 18+ to buy a beer. With the demo app, we
can demonstrate how such a wallet would work in a relatively simple way.

Although parts of this demo might later be used in wallet related projects, this demo is by no means
intended to be production quality code. The goal is to release the first working version of the
public reference wallet at the end of 2023 and to make it available in phases for various services.

# Current release

See the [releases page](https://github.com/MinBZK/nl-wallet-demo-app/releases) for the latest
release. The current releases are a clickable demo app that show a number of 'flows' that the user
of a wallet can walk through in the context of example use cases. These try out use cases have been
chosen because of a variety of reasons: what we want to show, what we want to learn, if they are
realistic use cases in practice, and if it is feasible to prototype them in this phase. You can
follow the latest work by subscribing to the releases of this GitHub repository at the top of this
page.

# Documentation

**TL;DR**

With the NL reference wallet we want to achieve the following things:

- We want to validate the feasibility of the framework as proposed in the EU.
- We want to explore how we can set the bar in terms of privacy protection, security, usability and
  inclusion.
- We want to learn what this development means for citizens, businesses, other governments and
  public service providers.
- We want to help citizens, especially those with special needs, in the best way possible.
- We want to offer a testing ground for a variety of use cases.
- We want to share the lessons we learn with the public and share them with the EU.

If you want to learn more about the NL Wallet development, please read the background information on
the Pleio hub. The development of the user flows and screens can be followed
through [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/dO5pKIIIyDgG0N2ZX4C2xd/2212_V1_Designs_NL-Voorbeeld-Wallet?node-id=1%3A3717&t=nwzAEOJZJEb0eC0o-1)
.

# Contributing

Weâ€™re releasing the source code with the explicit intention of allowing contributions. The
coordination of the project lies with the development team of the European Digital Identity Progam,
but weâ€™re open to all contributions. You can directly create a new Pull Request via Github,or
contact the community manager
via [edi@minbzk.nl](mailto:edi@minbzk.nl?subject=Contribution%20via%20GitHub).

The development team works on the repository in a private fork (for reasons of compliance with
existing processes) and shares its work as often as possible. If you watch the repository on GitHub,
you will be notified of a new release. We will also send a notification through Pleio.

Although we are open to contributions, please consider the nature of this project as outlined in
this Readme. At this stage the most useful way to contribute to the project is to participate on our
community site [edi.pleio.nl](https://edi.pleio.nl), and visit
our [EDI Meet-ups and/or Heartbeats](https://edi.pleio.nl/events).

If you plan to make non-trivial changes, we recommend that you open an issue beforehand where we can
discuss your planned changes. This increases the chance that we might be able to use your
contribution (or it avoids doing work if there are reasons why we wouldn't be able to use it).

Note that all commits should be signed using a GPG key.

# Getting started

## Setup development environment

The app's UI is build using Flutter, but to avoid tying the app to Flutter & Dart, all core business
logic is build using Rust. This gives us the more flexibility to migrate to completely native
iOS/Android app's if the need arises. This does mean building the app is slightly more complex than
a simple `flutter run`. This section describes how to set up your environment.

### Requirements:

- Flutter
- Rust (incl. additional targets)
- Android SDK + NDK (for Android builds)
- Xcode (for iOS builds)

#### Flutter

For help getting started with Flutter development, view
the  [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on
mobile development, and a full API reference. You can validate your setup by
running `flutter doctor` after the installation.

#### Rust

To install Rust & Cargo (the package manager) follow
the [installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). After installing rust make sure
to add the following targets:

- For iOS: `rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios`
- For
  Android: `rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi x86_64-linux-android`

#### Android

To build for android you need to have the Android SDK and NDK installed on your system. Likely the
easiest way to do so is:

1. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (includes SDK)
2. Open Android Studio
    1. Tools -> SDK Manager
    2. Select 'SDK Tools' Tab
    3. Uncheck 'hide obsolete packages'
    4. Check 'NDK (obsolete)' in the list
    5. Hit 'apply' to install (version 22.1.7171670)
3. Tell gradle where it can find the NDK by updating one of your `gradle.properties`,
   e.g. `echo "ANDROID_NDK_HOME=\"$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/ndk-bundle\"" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties`
4. Finally run `cargo install cargo-ndk` to be able to build the Rust code for Android

#### iOS

Install [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

### Validate

After doing the above `flutter doctor` should report that at least the following are installed
successfully:

- Flutter
- Android toolchain
- Xcode

You should now be able to launch an Android Emulator or iOS Simulator and run the app
using `flutter pub get` followed by `flutter run`! ðŸŽ‰

# File structure

## Code

All `Dart` code goes in the `lib/` directory and their appropriate sub-directories.

All `Rust` code goes in the `rust_core/` directory and their appropriate sub-directories.

### Flutter <-> Rust Bridge
Communication between the Flutter and Rust layers relies on the `flutter_rust_bridge` package, the bridge code is generated. The definition of this bridge can is located at `/rust_core/src/api.rs` and generation is done with the following command:

```
cargo run --manifest-path rust_core/flutter_rust_bridge_codegen/Cargo.toml
```

The generated code is currently checked in, so that generation only has to be performed when the API changes.

## Assets

All files used by the project (like images, fonts, etc.), go into the `assets/` directory and their
appropriate sub-directories.

Note; the `assets/images/` directory
contains [resolution-aware images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware)
.

> Copyright note: place all non free (copyrighted) assets used under the `non-free/` directory inside the appropriate asset sub-directory.

## Localization

Text localization is enabled; currently supporting English & Dutch, with English set as primary (
fallback) language. Localized messages are generated based on `ARB` files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.

To support additional languages, please visit the tutorial
on [Internationalizing Flutter apps](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization)
.

Internally, this project uses the commercial Lokalise service to manage translations. This service
is currently not accessible for external contributors. For contributors with access, please
see [documentation/lokalise.md](./documentation/lokalise.md) for documentation.

# Architecture

The project uses the [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) package to handle state
management.

On top of that it follows the [BLoC Architecture](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/architecture) guide,
with a slightly fleshed out domain layer.

This architecture relies on three conceptual layers, namely:

- [UI Layer](#ui-layer)
- [Domain Layer](#domain-layer)
- [Data Layer](#data-layer)

![Architecture Overview](./architecture_overview.png)

## UI Layer

Responsible for displaying the application data on screen.

In the above diagram the **UI** node likely represents a `Widget`, e.g. in the form of a `xyzScreen`
, that observes the Bloc using one of the `flutter_bloc` provided Widgets. E.g. `BlocBuilder`.

When the user interacts with the UI, the UI is responsible for sending a corresponding `Event` to
the associated BLoC. The BLoC than processes this event and emits an updated `State` to the UI,
causing the UI to rebuild and render the new state.

## Domain Layer

Encapsulate business logic to make it reusable. UseCases are likely to be used by BLoCs to interact
with data, allowing the BLoCs to be concise and keep their focus on converting events into new
states.

Naming convention `verb in present tense + noun/what (optional) + UseCase` e.g. LogoutUserUseCase.

## Data Layer

Exposes application data to the rest of the application. Responsible for any CRUD like operations or
network interactions, likely through other classes in the form of DataSources.

## Motivation

The reason we opted for this BLoC layered approach with the intermediary domain layer is to optimize
for: Re-usability, Testability and Readability.

**Re-usable** because the usecases in the domain layer are focused on a single task, making them
convenient to re-use in multiple blocs when the same data or interaction is required on multiple (
ui) screens.

**Testable** because with the abstraction to other layers in the form of dependencies of a class,
the dependencies can be easily swapped out by mock implementations, allowing us to create small,
non-flaky unit tests of all individual components.

**Readable** because with there is a clear separation of concerns between the layers, the UI is
driven by data models (not by state living in UI components) and can thus be easily inspected, there
is a single source of truth for the data in the data layer and there is a unidirectional data flow
in the ui layer making it easier to reason about the transitions between different states.

Finally, since while we are developing the initial Proof of Concept it is unlikely that we will be
working with real datasources, this abstraction allows us to get started now, and in theory quickly
migrate to a fully functional app (once the data comes online) by replacing our MockRepositories /
MockDataSources with the actual implementations, without touching anything in the Domain or UI
Layer.

# Conventions

## Git

### Commit message

- Capitalize the subject line
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Wrap lines at 72 characters

### PR title

See [commit message](#commit-message).

### PR merge

- Default to squash merge (combined with PR title conventions)

## Dart

* Max. line length is set to 120 (Dart defaults to 80)
* Relative imports for all project files below `src` folder; for
  example: `import 'bloc/wallet_bloc.dart';`
* Trailing commas are added by default; unless it compromises readability

## Naming

* Folder naming is `singular` for folders below `src`; for example: `src/feature/wallet/widget/...`

## Testing

### Unit tests

* Test file name follows the convention: `{class_name}_test.dart`
* Test description follows the convention: `should {do something} when {some condition}`
* Tests are grouped* by the method they are testing

** Grouping tests by method is not required, but recommended when testing a specific method.

### UI / Golden tests

* UI Tests are part of the normal test files
* UI Tests are grouped in `Golden Tests`

Even though they run headless, UI tests are slower to run. The main goal of these tests are to:
- Verify correct behaviour on different configurations (orientation/display scaling/font scaling)
- Detect unexpected UI changes

As such we aim to keep the UI tests minimal, focusing on testing the most important states for a
screen. This can be done by providing a mocked bloc with the state manually configured in the test.

Note that the UI renders slightly differ per platform, causing small diffs (and failing tests) when
verifying on a different host platform (e.g. mac vs linux). To circumvent this issue, we opted to
only run UI tests on mac hosts for now. Because of this it is vital to only generate
new goldens on a mac host. This can be done with `flutter test --update-goldens --tags=golden`.

- To only verify goldens use `flutter test --tags=golden`
- To only verify other tests use `flutter test --exclude-tags=golden`

# Distribution

Follow these steps to (force) distribute internal `alpha` & `beta` builds that target the Android
platform":

### Alpha

> Use `Alpha` distribution at any time during development cycle.

* Push commit of your choosing to: alpha/v{X.Y.Z}
* After the GitHub Action has completed successfully; install the release via F-Droid repo

### Beta

> Use `Beta` distribution at the end of a sprint cycle; to represent the sprint demo version.

* `$ git fetch && git pull`
* Push `main` branch to: beta/v{X.Y.Z}
* After the GitHub Action has completed successfully; install the release via F-Droid repo

# Troubleshooting

### Initial checkout / branch switch

Generate/update localisation files (to compile/run the project successfully):

    $ flutter gen-l10n
