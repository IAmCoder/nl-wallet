```
Within the European Digital Identity program of the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, a team is working on a Dutch Public Reference Wallet: the NL Wallet. The development of a public and open source reference wallet is a dynamic process. What has been released in the current version, may in a next version be developed further, be modified drastically or even removed altogether.

This version of the app is an internal testing version, not intended for wide distribution.
