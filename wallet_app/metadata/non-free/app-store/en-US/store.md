DISCLAIMER 
This is a demo version of the NL Wallet app. This app is currently in development and only offers some basic functions. It is not yet possible to access online services with it. 
 

EUROPEAN DIGITAL IDENTITY  
The Dutch government is working on a new app that allows citizens to securely and easily log in and use their data online. These digital wallets give users control over their online activities within the EU. The NL Wallet is being developed by the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. This wallet app focuses on privacy, security, and accessibility, ensuring everyone can use digital services safely and easily. These developments are open and transparent and can be followed on edi.pleio.nl. 


KEY FEATURES 
- Share information and log in to public and commercial services across the EU. 
- Designed for all accessibility needs. 
- Transparent activity log to track your online activities. 

 
HOW DO I START? 
The NL Wallet works only on smartphones. To activate it, you need the DigiD app, a Dutch driver's license issued on or after November 14, 2014, and the corresponding PIN code. In the future, additional methods for activating the app will be available. Once the wallet is activated, your personal data will be added to the app, ready to be shared and used for logging in. You can then add more digital cards to your wallet. 

 
HOW DOES IT WORK? 
Use the NL Wallet app to log in or share information with affiliated organizations. These organizations will have a 'use ID Wallet' option. This option will either directly open the request in your NL Wallet app or let you scan a QR code with the NL Wallet app to open it. The request allows you to review the organization details, requested data, and agreements. You can agree or decline. You are in control. If you agree, the transaction is confirmed and logged into the app's activity overview. 
 

DATA PROCESSING & PRIVACY 
If you use the NL Wallet, some personal data will be processed. When you log in, your BSN is sent to the NL Wallet via DigiD. By using the app, you agree to this data processing, which includes the following: 
- Your data is processed according to the General Data Protection Regulation and the privacy policy. 
- NL Wallet has security measures to protect against data loss or unlawful processing. 
- You are responsible for securing your mobile device. 
- App updates may be downloaded and installed via the app store. These updates improve, expand, or develop the app, including bug fixes and new features. Without updates, the app may not work properly. 
- NL Wallet can stop offering the app in the app store or discontinue its operation without notice.
