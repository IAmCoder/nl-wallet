This package contains the code generated by `flutter_rust_bridge`, it is moved out of `wallet_app`
and into a separate package to have a clear separation between the UI logic and the business logic
and to allow us to create a fully functional mock implementation. That way the `wallet_app` will no
longer be concerned about interacting with the mock or core api, as all of that logic can be moved
to the dedicated `wallet_core` and `wallet_mock` packages.
