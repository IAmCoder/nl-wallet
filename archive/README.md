# Archive

This folder contains several sections of code that were once implemented for the NL Wallet, but are now no longer used.
The code is archived here for demonstrative purposes only, and might not be complete, functional or in a compiling state.

The archive contains the following subdirectories, grouped by functionality:
- `mdoc-issuance`
- `mdoc-disclosure`
